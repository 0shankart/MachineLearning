# Machine Learning Notes
This repo talks about the theoretical and practical aspects of selected machine learning algorithms from the traditional and probabilistics point of view and will try to implement the code in `python`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `pytorch`.

The section is divided into two parts i) Machine Learning ii) Deep Learning. These sections will contains only the most used algorithms

This will be iterative process, where I come and update the algorithms based on the feasibility. I do see that most of the notebooks need some editing and should be revisied it to the vector notation in code instead of scalar.
