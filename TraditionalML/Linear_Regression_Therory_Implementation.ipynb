Whereas batch gradient descent has to scan through the entire training set before taking a single step$-$a cpst;u p[eratopm of n is large$-$stochastic gradient descent can start making progress right away and continues to ,make progress with each example it looks at. Often, stochastic gradient descent gets $\\theta$ \"close to the minimum much faster than batch gradient descent. (Note however that it may never \"converge\" to the minimum, and the parameters $\\theta$ will keep oscillating around the minimum of the $J(\\theta)$; but in practise most of the values near the minimum will be reasonably good approximations to the true minimum. By slowly letting the learning rate $\\alpha$ decrease to zero as the algorithm runs, it is also possible to ensure that the parameters will converge to the global minimum rather than merely oscillate around the minimum.) For these reasons, particularly when the training set is large, stochastic gradient descent is often preferred voer batch gradient descent.\n",
